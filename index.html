        <p style="color:white">
            Destiny 2 is a completely free game. It has a unique storyline and has introduced the main villian recently
            called The Witness. The Witness is the one behind these dark pyramids and many have landed on different
            planets/moons like Europa, Earths moon, and Savathun's Thorne World. Now that you know about the main 
            villian let's talk about you... Guardian! You are called a guardian because you are a Earth military person 
            who travels through space defeating anything that wants to destroy a planet or where all guardians hang out
            which would be the tower. There at the tower you do your cashing in for armor and weapons. Let's take a look
            at what classes you can be and the abilities you can use.
